## Summary

This commit adds an RFD documenting the e94ea1b anvil-review workflow fix. The new
review is readable and mostly accurate, but it violates the documentation style
guide on line lengths and includes a misleading statement about heredoc escaping.

---

## Findings

### 1. MEDIUM: Markdown line length violations in the new RFD

**Severity:** Medium
**File:** `docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-e94ea1b-hammer-review.md`
**Lines:** 13, 31, 40, 42, 90, 121

**Analysis:** `docs/AGENTS.md` requires Markdown lines to stay at or below 120
characters. Multiple lines in the new RFD exceed that limit, which makes the file
harder to read and will likely trip `markdownlint` if it is run as suggested in
the docs guidance.

**Recommendation:** Wrap the long sentences into multiple lines so all lines are
<=120 characters.

### 2. LOW: Misleading wording about `PROMPT_B64` escaping

**Severity:** Low
**File:** `docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-e94ea1b-hammer-review.md`
**Line:** 42

**Analysis:** The review claims the `PROMPT_B64` assignment uses proper escaping,
but that line is intentionally expanded in the outer shell (no escaping). The
statement is slightly inaccurate and could confuse readers about which variables
are meant to be expanded locally vs. remotely.

**Recommendation:** Rephrase the verification line to clarify that `PROMPT_B64` is
expanded locally while `PROMPT` uses escaped references for remote expansion.

## Recommended Actions

1. Reflow the long lines in `docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-e94ea1b-hammer-review.md` to
   comply with the 120-character limit.
2. Correct the wording about `PROMPT_B64` escaping to distinguish local expansion
   from remote expansion.
